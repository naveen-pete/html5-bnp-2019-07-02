                    If you think you can never make that perfect sponge cake, then try this simple recipe and you will surely become a master in rolling out the perfect homemade cake. It is a simple recipe and you can begin by mixing sugar and butter together. Whisk well until light and fluffy. Then, take a manual whisker or a fork, if you do not have one. Even electrical blenders are good. Once done, add the beaten eggs and blend well. Beat further so that the mixture gets a light, white appearance.

                    Sift together the maida and baking soda. It is done to evenly distribute the baking soda in flour. Gradually add this to the egg mixture. If required add a little milk and mix till the batter is fluffy and soft. Add vanilla essence and blend well. Vanilla essence is important to camouflage the smell of eggs.

                    Sprinkle some maida on a greased baking tin. It will prevent sticking of the cake to the base, you can also line it with a butter paper. Pour the prepared mixture into the tin and place it in a pressure cooker. Do not add water in the cooker and ensure that the tin does not touch the base of cooker. You can keep the baking dish on an inverted steel plate. Increase the flame and pressure cook for two minutes. Now remove the whistle and cook on low flame for 35-40 minutes. If you are using an electric oven, cook at 180 degrees for 30-35 minutes.

                    Insert a knife or a metal skewer into the cake and if it comes out clean, then the cake is ready to devour in. Remove from the oven/cooker and allow to cool on a wire rack.
