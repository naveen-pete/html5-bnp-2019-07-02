            <h2>Man from Peru</h2>
            <p>There once was a man from Peru,
                Who had a lot of growing up to do.
                He'd ring a doorbell,
                then run like hell,
                Until the owner shot him with a .22</p>

        <div id="fellow-named-gus">
            <h2>Fellow named Gus</h2>
            <p>There was an odd fellow named Gus,
                When travelling he made such a fuss.
                He was banned from the train,
                Not allowed on a plane,
                And now travels only by bus.</p>

        <div id="farmer-from-leeds">
            <h2>Farmer from Leeds</h2>
            <p>There once was a farmer from Leeds,
                Who swallowed a packet of seeds.
                It soon came to pass,
                He was covered with grass,
                But has all the tomatoes he needs.</p>

        <div id="woman-named-bright">
            <h2>Woman named Bright</h2>
            <p>There was a young woman named Bright,
                Whose speed was much faster than light.
                She set out one day,
                In a relative way,
                And returned on the previous night.</p>

        <div id="man-from-tibet">
            <h2>Man from Tibet</h2>
            <p>There once was a man from Tibet,
                Who couldn't find a cigarette.
                So he smoked all his socks,
                and got chicken-pocks,
                and had to go to the vet.</p>

        <div id="child-in-spain">
            <h2>Child in Spain</h2>
            <p>There once was a child in Spain,
                Who loved to play in the rain.
                One day he tripped,
                And broke his hip,
                Now he is in serious pain.</p>
