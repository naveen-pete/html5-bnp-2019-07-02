            <p>There once was a man from Peru,
                Who had a lot of growing up to do.
                He'd ring a doorbell,
                then run like hell,
                Until the owner shot him with a .22</p>

            <h2>Fellow named Gus</h2>
            <p>There was an odd fellow named Gus,
                When travelling he made such a fuss.
                He was banned from the train,
                Not allowed on a plane,
                And now travels only by bus.</p>
