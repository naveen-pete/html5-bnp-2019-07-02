        <h1>The Browser styles (useragent stylesheet)</h1>
        <hr />

        <h3>Useragent stylesheet</h3>
        The browser provides default styles for many elements. Some examples are...
        <ul>
            <li>Most browsers provide a small margin for the body element</li>
            <li>Lists have default styles like padding etc. and are bulleted/numbered.</li>
            <li>Links are underlined, colored in blue (unvisited) and have different colors in different "states" - for example, when active they have a different color (mouse is clicked and held over them); once visited they have another color (linked document is present is browser's history).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h3>Overriding the default styles by the author's stylesheet</h3>
        The default styles can be overriden by author styles (as a developer you are the author of a web page and its styles). For example, we can remove margins for the body, or apply CSS to style a link to look like a button. We have earlier also seen how to change bullets/numbering in a list or even remove them completely.
